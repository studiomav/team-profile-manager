# Team Profile Manager
### A team management script

This repository is for a team member html page generation project made for my UC Berkeley coding bootcamp. It ouputs a pre-formatted html file based on user input, making it quicker and easier to create team member rosters without unnecessary boilerplate.

A video walkthrough is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v_6i_9T3OqCynhxagtqdXXyjaFtFqhrc/view?usp=sharing).

There is no license for this project and it is intended for educational purposes only.
